I work at the intersection of design, computer science, and
sociology. There are no traffic signals so it is kinda dangerous to
stay in that intersection, but it sure is fun.

My startup makes [Zotebook](http://zotebook.io), an app for designing
things for laser cutting. It was based on my PhD work from
CMU. Basically, instead of treating sketch recognition as a machine
learning or AI problem, I treat it as a (much easier) interaction
design problem.

This is like the ninth time I've had a blog. The first was from 1996
(before 'blog' was a word), which I made out of bits of Perl 4 and
bash scripts as a way to teach myself how to program.

The most recent of my blogs is [still there](http://johnsogg.blogspot.com/2013/05/things-i-learned-in-school.html?view=flipcard), mouldering away at Blogger.

I live in Boulder CO.
